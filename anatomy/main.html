  <h2>Anatomy of a blab</h2>

  Blab is short for web laboratory, like blog is short for web log. A
  blab is a short(ish) presentation, usually involving computation in
  the STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics).

  The computation is done locally, in the browser, via a
  [http://puzlet.org/doc/import-export/, special brew of
  CoffeeScript].

  Behind the scenes, a blab is set of files managed and served by
  GitHub (although entirely local operation is perfectly fine). The
  puzlet.js application processes and presents the files.

  The important parts of a blab are:

  <h3>file: resources.json</h3>
  
  A list of resources to be processed by the puzlet.js app. 

  <h3>var: $blab</h3>

  A global variable uses to pass data and functions between javascript
  files.
