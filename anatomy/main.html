  <h2>Anatomy of a blab</h2>

  Blab is short for web laboratory, like blog is short for web log. A
  blab is a short(ish) web page, often involving computation in the
  STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics).

  The computation is done locally, in the browser, via a
  [http://puzlet.org/doc/import-export/, special brew of
  CoffeeScript].

  Behind the scenes, a blab is set of files managed and served by
  GitHub (although entirely local operation is fine). The
  [https://github.com/puzlet, puzlet.js] application processes and
  presents the files.

  The important parts of a blab are:

  <h4>resources.json</h4>
  
  A list of resources to be processed by the puzlet.js app. For example:

  <ul>
    <li>local .html, .css, .js, .json, .coffee files;</li>
    <li>.js files from elsewhere on the web;</li>
    <li>.coffee files from elsewhere (subsequently compiled);</li>
    <li>GitHub hosted files (via GitHub's API).</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>blab namespace</h4>

  The $blab variable is used as a global namespace to pass variables
  between javascript TBD.

  <h4>index.html</h4>

  Every blab has an (often simple) index.html to call the puzlet.js
  app.
